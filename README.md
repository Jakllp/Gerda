# Gerda
A roguelike-mining game

# For development
For performance reasons with y-sorting on TileMaps and navigation edge-connection we use a custom Godot Build that can be found [here](https://github.com/Three-s-A-Crowd-Games/godot).  
It can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/Three-s-A-Crowd-Games/godot/releases/tag/4.0.4-rc)
